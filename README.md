Pixel It, WS2812b 8x32 Led Matrix Display Software for ESP8266 ESP-01 Module

ESP8266 ESP-01 Version of Pixel IT

Removed MP3, LDR and DHT Libraries, changed the PIN to gpio2 so it works with ESP-01 Module.

Just flash the .bin file to your ESP-01 Module, connect the GPIO2 pin to Data Pin of the Matrix and you are good to go.

I recommend to use a ws2812b driver module for ESP-01
